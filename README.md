*Send a ChatGPT chat to Figshare and get a DOI with a Chrome Extension*

Academics may wish to capture their interactions with ChatGPT, not just for posterity but as a citable artifact. DOIit is a Chrome Extension that allows a user to save chat data to Figshare and then create a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that interaction. This extension uses the Figshare API, and therefore, requires an API key from Figshare to function properly.

This README was written with the help of ChatGPT. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22350943.v1" alt="DOI README">

The code for this extension was partially written by ChatGPT. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22350715.v1" alt="DOI README">
